# Retrospective:
We started off trying a test driven approach with this assignment. This gave a good starting point for understanding the specifications and forming an idea of the implementation. However after starting the implementation there were many other classes that had to be individually tested. It became a bit of a rush to test all the classes and functions to increase the line coverage.
