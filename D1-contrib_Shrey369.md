My commits were mostly on the query branch and the testing branch, as I didnt want to work on the same branch as my partner.

#Retrospective:
Since we started off with a test-driven approach, I got into writing a lot of tests. But due to time constraints, we tried to finish off as much as we could first and my partner ended up doing a lot of implementation while I wrote most of the tests. For the next deliverable, I plan on being more proactive so we can get 100% coverage.
